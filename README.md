# pyPLD 
pyPLD is a python library to simulate the amount of material deposited during thin film growth with pulsed laser deposition (PLD). 

The method and its assumptions are described in the article Improved methods for design of PLD and combinatorial PLD films, Journal of Applied Physics 132, 125301 (2022); https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0105298.
